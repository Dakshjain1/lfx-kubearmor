# lfx-kubearmor



resolved by triggering action only on issue comment - # pull request to run on only policy files, not on readme updates.
# git diff se fetch the file change to get the folder name - rename all postgres to {{ folder name}}
not required bcz branch is created by user - # change branch name as well to folder name unique if possible.

# instead of rm -rf ./postgres/README.md remove top 5 lines from the file - suggest better way

done - # issue comment trigger only when comment match

# add status checks
